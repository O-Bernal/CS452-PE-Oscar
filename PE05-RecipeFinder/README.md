# Input
The Recipe Finder application accepts user input through the React frontend. 
- Users can enter recipe details such as name, ingredients, instructions, and notes using controlled form components on the Add Recipe and Edit Recipe pages. 
- Users also interact with the interface by clicking navigation links, selecting recipes from the list, and triggering actions such as edit or delete. 

The frontend sends this input to the backend API as JSON payloads using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

# Process
The Express backend receives requests and routes them through the /recipes endpoints. It connects to a MongoDB Atlas database using the MongoDB Node.js driver. 

The server validates the incoming data, then performs the appropriate database operation: inserting new recipe documents, updating existing ones, deleting records, or querying for recipe lists and individual recipes. 

The backend returns JSON responses that represent the current state of the data.

# Output
The React frontend renders the JSON responses into a user-friendly interface. The Recipe List page displays all stored recipes with links to view details. When a recipe is selected, its full information—ingredients, instructions, and notes—is shown alongside the list within the same layout. 

After create, update, or delete operations, the UI refreshes to reflect the latest database state. Together, the frontend and backend provide a complete input–process–output cycle for managing recipes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
