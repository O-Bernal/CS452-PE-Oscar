# Repository Overview
## This repository is for the City Univeristy of Seattle and contains programming exercises for Fall 2025 CS452 Backend Web Development.
### PE01 - Resume
- PE01 covered MERN fundamentals and a template resume was developed as an example
- *Note to self:* This PE exercise did remind me that I had it in my backlog to digitize my resume/portfolio into a webpage. It's a good way to showcase my familiarity and technical skill with MERN architeture.

### PE02 - Movie List
- The goal in PE02 is to create a movie list app in order to strengthen understanding of React components and other foundational concepts.
- The movie list app lets you filter movies by genre and see movies in the list based on selection. Clicking a movie alerts what was clicked on.

### PE04 - Cities
- PE04's objective was to create a React app with Navigation based on understanding of React Router
- The Cities app let's you add City Data to a list, and clicking an entry in the list displays the details entered for that city.
