### PE01 - Resume
- PE01 covered MERN fundamentals and a template resume was developed as an example
- *Note to self:* This PE exercise did remind me that I had it in my backlog to digitize my resume/portfolio into a webpage. It's a good way to showcase my familiarity and technical skill with MERN architeture.

### PE02 - Movie List
- The goal in PE02 is to create a movie list app in order to strengthen understanding of React components and other foundational concepts.
- The movie list app lets you filter movies by genre and see movies in the list based on selection. Clicking a movie alerts what was clicked on.
